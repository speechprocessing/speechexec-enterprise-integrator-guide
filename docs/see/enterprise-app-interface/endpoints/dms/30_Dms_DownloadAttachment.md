# Download attached document of a dictation
{% include see/enterprise-app-interface/EAI_AllEndpoints_TOC.md %}

## Prerequisites

HTTP request authentication must be set up properly.
You can find more information [here](./10_DmsAuthentication.md).

## Overview

![/dms/dictations workflow overview](static/images/diagrams/EAI_DMS_DownloadAttachedDocument.png)

## Procedure

To download the attached document of a given dictation belonging to a specific `SpeechExec Enterprise` author user, the `GET /dms/dictations/{AuthorName}/{DictationID}/attachment` endpoint can be used. This endpoint requires an `AuthorName` and a `DictationID` query parameters which define the `SpeechExec Enterprise` author user and the desired dictation's ID to look for, respectively.

The dictation file is searched in the user's archive folder first, then in the user's finished dictation's folder if it wasn't found in the archive.

The call returns with a file stream of the dictation's attached document.

The call returns with `HTTP 400-BadRequest` in the following cases:

- `{AuthorName}` is null or empty string
- `{DictationID}` is not a valid GUID
- The requested user is not member of the Enterprise subsystem

The call returns with `HTTP 401-Unauthorized` if the authentication prerequisites are not fulfilled.

The call returns with `HTTP 404-NotFound` in the following cases:

- the dictation with the specified `{DictationID}` was not found in the cache database
- the dictation has no attachment
- the dictation is not in `Transcription finished` state

The call returns with `HTTP 500-InternalServerError` if any other error occurs. 

The call returns with `HTTP 200-OK` if the attachment download is successful.

In all error cases, the exact error reason can be found in the response body, in the `FailureCode` field.
